Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.

4. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: OOP focuses on the data, functional programming focuses on logic
  Tenants of OOP
    - encapsulation - variables and methods inside a function are only available inside the function, scope should not bleed
    - abstraction - knowledge of the inner workings of a particular scope should not be needed in order to implement it
    - polymorphism - parent classes should be adaptable to many sub classes to keep the parent class reusable
    - inheritance - relationship between classes help create reusable code

I just looked these up, so I am still learning about them so I'll tell you what I learned, but I don't necessarily think they are the most detailed answers.
    Tenants of Functional
    - pure function - functions should not have side effects, same input should produce the same output
    - referential transparency - if you replace a function with its output the program shouldn't change the program (related to pure functions)
    - immutability - state cannot be changed after it is created
    - functions as first class entities/higher order functions - functions can be passed as arguments
    - type systems - avoid type coercion by checking for data types in the function
