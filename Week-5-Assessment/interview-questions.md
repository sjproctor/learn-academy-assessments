# ASSESSMENT 5: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. Rails follows an MVC pattern. What does that mean?

  MVC is an architecture pattern for organizing an application. MVC stands for Model, View, Controller. The model layer is the database or business logic layer, the View is what the user sees and interacts with, the controller routes the application to the correct view and displays the correct information from the model.
