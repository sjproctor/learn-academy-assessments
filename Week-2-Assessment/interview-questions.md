6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer: JavaScript runs top to bottom and when the app is complied it searches for all the functions declared in the app. JavaScript assumes that a function would not be declared without being called so in an effort to make the program faster it "hoists" the functions to the top of the call stack and waits for the function call. This has a side effect of making the function variables available before any other code.
