# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. The built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer: Three built in parameters: value, index, array, in that order, value is required, index and array are optional



2. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer: Taking a object keys and set into variables, the pathway through the object to that particular key, unpacking the variable from the object

  let { innerKey } = object.outerKey



3. Why would you use the method super()?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer: Passes information from the parent's constructor, super implies there is a parent class



4. What is a React Fragment? Why would you use one?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer: Must return just one JSX elements, wraps all of the content returning from a component, doesn't add a node to the DOM



5. What is JSX?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer: Marriage between JavaScript and HTML, created by React devs to render HTML to the DOM inside of a JS file



6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer: The browser does a quick initial scan of the code. The assumption is that functions will all get called at some point. So to make the program run faster all the JavaScript methods get "hoisted" to the top of stack call, which means a function can be called before it is defined
