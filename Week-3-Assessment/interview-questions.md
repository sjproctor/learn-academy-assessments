# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.

1. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: A shortcut for creating a variable that holds the full value of a location of a key nested within an object or array

  Researched answer:



2. What are the three arguments that .map() and .filter() can accept?

  Your answer: value, index, array - in that particular order

  Researched answer:



3. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: A class is a blueprint for creating many objects, it is composed of both data and behaviors (information and methods), an object is an instance of a class

  Researched answer:



4. What is the difference between a HTML div and a span?

  Your answer: divs are block elements (like having a line break before and after, they take the full view width) and spans are inline elements (they only take as much space as allotted, can be as small as one word within a paragraph)

  Researched answer:



5. What is React.Fragment and why would you want to use it?

  Your answer: The syntax for returning multiple JSX tags by wrapping them in a neutral outer tag, <> </> is a shorthand for React.Fragment that achieves the same result

  Researched answer:



6. What are three options for creating responsive design?

  Your answer: Flexbox, media queries, em/rem/%, grid layout

  rem/em both translate into pixels
  All browsers have a small amount of base css
  When you put plain old HTML in the browser the text has a base pixel - usually a 16 point font
  So 1rem is that base font size
  rem stands for root em

  So em is a size that is relative to the current font size. Whatever the current font size may be.
  So it could be the 16 point base font that is set by the browser or it could be a font that you set for your application.

  Just a bit of fun history: I was looking up the difference between rem and em and I learned that em is not an acronym like I originally thought. The origin is a standardization of typeface based on capital letter M.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week
- Object oriented programming - a programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic
- irb - Interactive RuBy, a way to run Ruby code in the console
- Instance variable - a variable declaration that begins with @ making the variable available to the entire scope of the class/instances of the class rather than just within a single method
- Ruby hash - a dictionary-like collection of key:value pairs
- Class relationships - is_a, has_a, has_many, belongs_to describes relationships between classes/model classes
- Getter and Setter methods in Ruby - setters define an instance variable and getters return the value of an instance variable
