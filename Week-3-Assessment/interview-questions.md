# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

7. STRETCH: What does it mean to create a responsive UI? What are three options for creating responsive design?

  Your answer: Your app will still look good and function well no matter the screen size or orientation, media queries, grid, flexbox, rem/vh/vw/%

  Researched answer: rem/em both translate into pixels

  All browsers have a small amount of base css
  When you put plain old HTML in the browser the text has a base pixel - usually a 16 point font
  So 1rem is that base font size
  rem stands for root em

  So em is a size that is relative to the current font size. Whatever the current font size may be.
  So it could be the 16 point base font that is set by the browser or it could be a font that you set for your application.

  Just a bit of fun history: I was looking up the difference between rem and em and I learned that em is not an acronym like I originally thought. The origin is a standardization of typeface based on capital letter M.
